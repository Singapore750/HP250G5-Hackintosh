# HP 250 G5 Hackintosh
## Things that don't work (for Monterey)  
* wireless internet (intel card) --*ethernet does work, however*
* trackpad buttons (can't click, but can move pointer) - use a USB Mouse
* bluetooth - use [snapdrop](https://snapdrop.io)

If you want the wifi, trackpad, and bluetooth to work and are fine using Big Sur use [L9PYKE's EFI](https://github.com/L9PYKE/HPG5250BIGSUR)

## After downloading EFI
* create your own USB map using [USBToolBox](https://github.com/USBToolBox/tool) [helpful tutorial](https://lzhoang2601.github.io/) by Hoàng Hồng Quân (your selection of ports may not be the same as mine)
* generate your serial and SMBIOS following the dortania guide 

## CURRENTLY TESTING NEW EFI!!!
