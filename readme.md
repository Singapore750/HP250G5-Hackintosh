# HP 250 G5 Hackintosh
## Things that don't work (for Monterey)
* wireless internet (intel card) --*ethernet does work, however*
* trackpad buttons (can't click, but can move pointer)
* bluetooth
* graphics acceleration (will fix soon, accidentally spoofed Skylake to Kaby Lake for use in VENTURA, but on the monterey EFI)
