# HP 250 G5 Hackintosh
## Things that don't work (for Monterey)
* wireless internet (intel card) --*ethernet does work, however*
* trackpad buttons (can't click, but can move pointer)
* bluetooth

If you want the wifi, trackpad, and bluetooth to work and are fine using Big Sur use [L9PYKE's EFI](https://github.com/L9PYKE/HPG5250BIGSUR)
